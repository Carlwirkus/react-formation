# Inspiration

I've been working with Formik in a B2B SaaS application and I really like the Formik API. However, there is an
issue with formik where every field is re-rendered when the values change. I recently watched a video by Jack Herrington
on how to use context with useSyncExternalStore and I wanted to try implementing that with a Formik like api.
